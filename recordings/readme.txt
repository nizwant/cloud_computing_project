We will not store recordings, we won't even
process them on server (this is "to be decided")
but for the ease of development and testing purposes, we will store some
created by us in the "recordings" directory.


The naming convention is as follows:
_org_0x is a trimmed fragment of the original song, here x just differentiates between different fragments
_no_noise_0x is a recording with a phone microphone of song without any environment noise
_cafe_0x is a recording with a phone microphone of song with cafe noises, larger x - louder environment noise
_street_0x is a recording with a phone microphone of song with street noises, larger x - louder environment noise

The recordings have different lengths, longer than 5 seconds, majority of them are 5-7 seconds long. The longest is 13 seconds.
The recordings are in .m4a format.
