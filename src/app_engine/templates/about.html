  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <p>Welcome to the page about our Cloud Computing project! We're a team of students from the Warsaw University of Technology, diving into the world of cloud services to build something practical and fun. For us this project is the perfect opportunity to get hands-on experience with Google Cloud Platform (GCP).</p>

  <h2>Who We Are</h2>

  <h2>What We're Building</h2>

  <p>Our project is a song recognition application, much like a simpler version of Shazam. Have you ever heard a song playing and wondered, "What is this tune?" That's exactly the problem we're trying to solve!</p>

  <p>The idea is simple: a user can record a short snippet of a song or upload an audio file through a web interface. Our application will then process this audio, compare it against a database of known songs, and hopefully tell you exactly what song it is, and even provide a link to a YouTube video.</p>

  <p>This project is our playground to explore and utilize various GCP services, focusing on serverless and PaaS options like Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, App Engine, Cloud SQL, Pub/Sub, and Cloud Load Balancing. We're also using tools like Terraform for infrastructure as code and implementing CI/CD pipelines to streamline our development process.</p>

  <h2>Project Requirements</h2>

  <p>Based on the course guidelines, our project needs to meet several key requirements:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Some kind of UI</li>
      <li>Used persisted Storage</li>
      <li>Terraform</li>
      <li>Large-scale assumption</li>
      <li>Rather Paas or Serverless than IaaS</li>
      <li><b>Queue</b></li>
      <li><b>Unit tests</b></li>
      <li><b>CI/CD</b></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The bolded requirements were created by us to make this task even more challenging</p>

  <h2>Architecture</h2>

  <p>Here is the high-level architecture diagram illustrating how the different components and services connect in our project:</p>

  <h2>Our Goal</h2>

  <p>Beyond building a functional application, our main goal is to learn by doing. The Cloud Computing course challenges us to think about scalability, efficiency, and the best way to leverage cloud technologies. This project is our answer to that challenge – a real-world application built on the principles we're learning.</p>

  <p>We're excited about the technical journey, from developing the core song fingerprinting algorithm to designing the architecture and deploying it all on GCP. It's a complex task, but we're breaking it down, tackling each piece, and learning immensely along the way.</p>

  <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about our project!</p>
